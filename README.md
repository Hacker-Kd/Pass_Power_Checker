Password Strength Checker

This Password Strength Checker is a simple Python script that assesses the strength of a password based on various factors such as length, complexity, and common patterns. It provides feedback to the user on the strength of their password and suggests improvements if necessary.
Features

    Assessment of Password Strength:
        The script analyzes the entered password and categorizes it as weak, moderate, or strong based on length, complexity, and common patterns.

    Secure Storage of Passwords:
        Passwords are securely hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm before storage. (Note: Storage is simulated in this script. In a real-world scenario, passwords would be stored securely in a database.)

    Generation of Secure Passwords:
        Users can generate secure random passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

How to Use

    Checking Password Strength:
        Run the script (password_strength_checker.py).
        Enter your desired password when prompted.
        The script will evaluate the strength of your password and provide feedback.

    Generating Secure Passwords:
        Run the script (password_strength_checker.py).
        Use the "Generate Secure Password" option to create a random secure password.
        The generated password will be displayed in a message box.

Additional Comments

    Code Comments:
        The Python script (password_strength_checker.py) contains comments throughout the code to explain the purpose of each part. This makes it easier for others (and yourself) to understand the functionality of the script.

    Integration with Database (Simulated):
        The script simulates integration with a database for storing and retrieving passwords securely. In a real-world scenario, you would use a database management system for this purpose.
